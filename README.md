# Hi, I’m Matías 👋

I’m a PhD candidate in Physics with a strong interest in **cosmology, statistical inference, and data analysis**.  
My research focuses on developing and applying statistical tools to test cosmological models against observational data, with particular emphasis on **tension metrics** and **model comparison**. I worked on testing alternative theries of gravity

---

## 🔭 Research Interests

- Cosmological parameter inference  
- Tension metrics and consistency tests between datasets  

I am especially interested in building **robust, interpretable statistical frameworks** that help quantify disagreements between datasets and assess the viability of alternative cosmological models.
