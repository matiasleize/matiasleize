## Hi there 👋

I'm a PhD candidate in Physics with a strong interest in **cosmology, statistical inference, and data analysis**.  
My research focuses on developing and applying statistical tools to test cosmological models against observational data, with particular emphasis on **tension metrics** and **model comparison**. I worked on testing alternative theries of gravity

My research focuses on developing and applying statistical tools to test cosmological models against observational data, with particular emphasis on **tension metrics**, **model comparison**, and **consistency tests** across multiple datasets.

I am especially interested in building robust and interpretable statistical frameworks that help assess the viability of alternative cosmological models and quantify discrepancies between observational probes.

### 🔭 Research Interests

- Cosmological parameter inference  
- Tension metrics and consistency tests between datasets
- Statistical methods for cosmology
- Testing extensions of the standard cosmological model
